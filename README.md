Hi! I'm Max, the renound maker of [Blaze Sudios](https://tsunami014.github.io/Blaze-Sudio) and friends with `@Stimbix` and `@Imzafish`. I make things with code. They're really cool things.

| Programming languages I'm *excellent* at | Programming languages I'm ok at |

| ![Python](https://badgen.net/badge/icon/python?icon=pypi&label&color=green) | ![JavaScript](https://badgen.net/badge/icon/JavaScript?icon=rss&label&color=orange) |

I can pick up other languages OK though, and would like to learn more! (I am making multiple projects with different languages, such as c++)

Go look at my [Codingame profile](https://www.codingame.com/profile/658075e0ba9b9b722ef519d0010b39fc9069326)!

Thinks I like:
- Wings of Fire (and dragons in general)
- Doggos
- Foxes
- Lots of documentation (although unfortunately lots of docs means lots of time spent writing docs, so I usually never get up to it ‚òπÔ∏è)
- When your code ACTUALLY WORKS and it's THE BEST!
- When you find that one stupid bug you've been looking for for AAGES that was something really stupid and now everything works
